# Unity-Movement
it's shit, don't use it.

if you are gonna use this for any sort of unity project, please credit me (though i won't force you cause I am a shit dev anyways).
it's simple to use, just put the script into unity and drag onto the gameobject you want to control (just make sure it has a rigidbody lol).
wasd you know the drill (though adjust the direction of the Vector3.xxxx if you need to!).
